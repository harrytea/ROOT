Please refine a list of image captions according to these guidelines:

1. Exclude any word that is not a noun.
2. If there are some similar words in the list, only retain the most unambiguous word. For example, you should only retrain "air conditioner" from ["vent", "air conditioning", "air conditioner"].
3. Exclude captions that do not refer to specific items, such as comment, device, mold and furniture.
4. Exclude captions that are not suitable for distance measurement between them, such as wall, room, platform, floor, ceiling and building.
5. The final output should only be the refined list. It should not contain any other elements and must be directly parseable by Python's json.loads() function.

Here's an example for reference:

Input list: [bed, building, bunk bed, clothesline, dormitory, equipment, floor, laundry, room, mold]
Output: [bunk bed, clothesline]

Now, apply these guidelines to refine the following list of image captions:
