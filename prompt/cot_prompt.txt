I am providing you a JSON file represented the vertical relation of the object, which displays the vertical relationship of the objects in the room. Please generate a description of their vertical relationship based on the JSON. Do not include objects that are not in the json and do not say \"based on the JSON file\" or other word include \"JSON file\". Provide the conclusion as easy as possible. Here is an example: the bathtub is supported by the floor, and the faucet is supported by the bathtub. The window is hanging on the wall. The recessed lighting_0 and recessed lighting_1 are attached to the ceiling. Please note, do not omit the number if \"_num\" is included behind the object.\n
