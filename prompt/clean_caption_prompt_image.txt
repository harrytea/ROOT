Given an image, please refine the list of image captions according to these guidelines:

1. Don't miss any detail and small item in the image.
2. Exclude any caption that does not appear in the image. But don't delete the captions refering to the small items in the image.
3. If present, include any additional captions that appear in the image but are missing from the list. 
4. Each captioning should be up to three words. Please try to use some specific, clear and unambiguous words as captions.
5. If necessay, rewrite the existing captions with more specific, clear and unambiguous words.
6. Ensure that the captions are suitable for measuring distances between them and exclude captions like walls, floors, ceiling or marble platforms.
7. The final output should only be the refined list. It should not contain any other elements and must be a list which is directly parseable by Python's json.loads() function.

Now, apply these guidelines to refine the following list of image captions:
