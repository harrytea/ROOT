Please provide a list of captions of the items in the given image according to these guidelines:

1. Ensure to include every detail and minor item visible in the image
2. In case of objects having a containment relationship, both the container and the contained items should be captioned concurrently. For instance, if a shelf filled with various items is visible, you must provide captions for the shelf together with each individual inside.
3. Each caption must be in singular form and up to two words. Please try to use some specific, clear and unambiguous words as captions.
4. Avoid duplication of captions. If the same item appears multiple times, only one caption should be provided.
5. Ensure that the captions are suitable for measuring distances between them and exclude captions like walls, floors, ceiling, wires or platforms.
6. The final output must be a list of item captions from the image. It should not contain any other elements and must be directly parseable by Python's json.loads() function.
